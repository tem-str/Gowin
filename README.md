## _Tang Nano 9K FPGA_ <a name="tang"></a> 
>(Gowin's LittleBee family the GW1NR-9)


Tang nano 9K is a development board based on Gowin GW1NR-9 FPGA chip.It equips with HDMI connector, RGB screen interface connector, SPI screen connector, 32Mbit SPI flash and 6 LEDs, so users can use it for FPGA verification, risc-v soft core verification and basic function verification easily and quickly. Its 8640 LUT4 logic units can not only be used for various complex logic circuits designing, but also used for running a complete PicoRV soft core. It also meets various needs of users, such as learning FPGA, verifying soft core and further design.

The following documents are very useful for learning FPGA and even if you have a lot of development experience, I recommend reading these documents, since this FPGA has some of its own features.

###  Some Intro <a name="int"></a> 

First of all, we are interesting in the integrated chip GW1NR-9, but not the whole board. The Tand Nano 9K is just a handy board with the necessary interface for learning, so let's get to know her a little.

>This repository was created just to try different projects with the GowinFPGA, test all communication protocol, working with Memory (Flash/RAM) and order opportunities of the board. In the future, this knowledge will be useful for other projects

 The goal of our project - try to make a bacis CPU, after testing a few simple projects.âœ’
 
```Verilog
module counter
(
    input clk,
    output [5:0] led
);

localparam WAIT_TIME = 13500000;
reg [5:0] ledCounter = 0;
reg [23:0] clockCounter = 0;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    clockCounter <= clockCounter + 1;
    if (clockCounter == WAIT_TIME) begin
        clockCounter <= 0;
        ledCounter <= ledCounter + 1;
    end
end

assign led = ~ledCounter;
endmodule
```
